## Rules for the Movie Tickets assignment

* Create a webpage where a user can select the name of a movie, the time of day that they would like to see the movie and their age. 

* The webpage should let them know how much their movie ticket will cost, based on those three factors.

* Consider that non-"first-release" movies, matinee and senior tickets tend to be cheaper than the regular priced ticket.

* Your constructor and prototype could be called Ticket and you can come up with the formula for determining how the price is calculated depending on the input from the user.

## Methodology

### _The following specs are included in the program:_

* Form input, with 'Add' as submit button
  INPUT: (Address)
  OUTPUT: List of contact fullname(s) as active link to to that contact on the 'Contacts:' list)

* Click "Another Address" button
    Display new form piece for Address
  INPUT: (Address, at bottom of form with new fields)
  OUTPUT: Display new form pieces

* 'Contacts:' list displays any added user fullname
  INPUT: Click on name
  OUTPUT: Display Contact to upper right of screen

* Require fields in HTML form

* Refactor and clean up code

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download the files from the repository into appropriately named directories.
* Open the files with the browser of your choice.
